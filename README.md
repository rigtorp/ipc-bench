ipc-bench
=========

Some very crude IPC benchmarks.

ping-pong latency benchmarks:
* pipes
* unix domain sockets
* tcp sockets

throughput benchmarks:
* pipes
* unix doamin sockets
* tcp sockets

one way latency benchmarks:
* shm

The shared memory benchmark is a kind of "control". If run under a
real-time OS it will give you the intra core communication
latency.
